## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words. This notebook utilizes a dataset of tweets about airlines to classify sentiments and visualize the findings. The analysis can provide insights into public perception of airline services and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this notebook is **AirlineTweets.csv**, which contains the following columns:

- `tweet_id`: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- `airline_sentiment`: Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).
- `airline_sentiment_confidence`: Confidence score of the sentiment classification.
- `negativereason`: Reason for negative sentiment, if applicable.
- `negativereason_confidence`: Confidence score for the negative reason.
- `airline`: Name of the airline.
- `airline_sentiment_gold`: Gold standard sentiment for comparison.
- `name`: User's name.
- `negativereason_gold`: Gold standard negative reason.
- `retweet_count`: Number of retweets.
- `text`: The content of the tweet.
- `tweet_coord`: Coordinates of the tweet location.
- `tweet_created`: Timestamp of the tweet.
- `tweet_location`: Location of the user.
- `user_timezone`: User's timezone.
